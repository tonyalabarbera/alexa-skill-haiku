shrieks of laughter fill the air.
Happy Halloween!`,

A taste, sweet as your first love.
Cold and refreshing`,

Silver scales shining brightly.
Down into the dark`,


  `Love is a feeling.
That you can not let go of.
For it is sticky`,


  `Parched throat, roasted skin,
Scorching sun rays, blazing winds.
Soul sizzling within!`,

The book flows and the sun glows .
Perfect summer day`,

Fish swimming with the current.
Life moving along.`,

whispers of truth reflections.
with fingers of love.`,

flowing of lightness and love.
aligned in being.`,


  `Love is not complex.
it demands an absent mind.
and a present heart.`,

  `Her dress spills open.
sudden flash of silk and skin.
sensual simplicity.`,

Scarves and sweaters everywhere.
Fall weather is here`,


  `I am over you.
Then my eyes meet yours once more,
and I fall in love.`,

  `The chill, worming in .
Shock, pleasure, bursting within .
Summer tongue awakes`
